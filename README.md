__You're interviewing for a job. You're resume says you're a MEAN stack developer
and the company you're interviewing for wants to see what you're made of. They've
given you 1.5 hours to stand up a blog application using the stack you claim to know.__

__Because you're a software developer and have the skills you need, they've given
you nothing to work with (aside from a few requirements below).
No stories, wireframes, etc. They want to see how you do on your own__

## Set up and delivery
```
Fork this repo. When time is up, the company wants you to make a pull request so their engineers can review your code.

They also want you to add your own comments to the bottom of this README at the end if you didn't finish, and talk about what you would do differently or why you didn't finish.

Be sure and follow all of these directions, companies are also checking your attention to detail and ability to follow directions.
```

#### Technological Requirements

* Node / Express
* Angular
* Mongo (persistant data)

#### MVP

* User can post a blog that is as long as they want it to be
* Blog post can (but doesn't _have_ to) include image urls (no image storage necessary)
* When the post is created, it is displayed with a title, author, post body, and
any image content.
* Other users can comment on blog posts

#### Nice to haves (if you finish the MVP in the time alotted)

* User auth

__Your app should look good. The company doesn't care if you use Bootstrap, or
want to handroll your CSS. They just want to see that you can make it look decent
in a short amout of time__

#### Your Approach

Take a minute to think things out and plan your first few steps. Stay calm. You may
not finish by the end of the allotted time, so which features are your first priority?
In the case that you aren't going to finish on time, prioritize a __half finished__
and not a __half assed__ looking app.

_Stay calm and code on!_


#What went wrong
I struggled with the app structure for a while and that chewed a portion of my time. I also have not used angular and express in conjunction before so I hit a wall at a certain point.
